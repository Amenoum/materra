*    MATERRA Installation    *
*                            *
******************************

NOTE: MATERRA should be installed in a root directory of a domain or a subdomain, 
otherwise it will be necessary to manually modify file references (links) in js files.


1. Copy the contents of public_html folder to your website root directory (generally public_html)

2. If you plan to allow user registration, copy the empty materra_db folder to the same directory holding the public_html folder 
	(or update users/users.settings.inc.php DB_USERS constant with a path where you want users database to be stored)

3. Run setup.php (ie. by visiting https://yourwebsite.com/setup.php where yourwebsite.com should be replaced with your domain or subdomain name)


Optional (changing settings): 

	If you want to change settings (for cache, etc.) you can do so by editing files ending with settings.inc.php (ie. check.settings.inc.php). 
	Each such file affects only specific function or area of the website (ie. check.settings.inc.php provides settings for check.php which is used to check for updates, 
	you can open .php files in a text editor to see what they are used for).


Note that, even if enabled, user registration will not be possible before the admin account is registered. 
Admin id (username) must be specified in users/users.settings.inc.php, by updating 
the ADMIN_ID constant. 
Afterwards, you can use ID command in MATERRA to change your id to specified admin id and then REG command to register the account.


	
Once installed, type "?" or "help" in the command line interface (CLI) for a list of commands. 
For additional documentation use "doc" command.
