# What is MATERRA

MATERRA is a web creation and publishing platform with strong emphasis on user/system interaction and customization possibilities.

For example, visitors to a website running on MATERRA can add new elements to a webpage, and even create new webpages which will automatically be accessible from the website menu.
Note that such changes are private - stored locally, in browser storage space.
Designed originally for the Amenoum website, but with reusability in mind, it is easy to setup (no databases necessary for its main functionality) and straight forward to use.

At the user end, MATERRA is powered by MATERRA OS, an operating system written in JS/jQuery which provides numerous interaction possibilities through its command line interface (CLI).

The word Materra is a composite of latin words mater (mother) and Terra (Earth).
