&lt;sub2&gt;<b>Prophecy</b>&lt;/sub2&gt;
<b>A prophecy is the announcement of an event supposed to happen some time in the future. It may be supplemented with time and additional details of the event. 
In order to be true, a prophecy must be relative. Thus, any true prophecy can describe the event of a local future only if the event has already occurred somewhere - in the environment 
of the same or similar species as the local environment, in which the event is supposed to happen. 
While prophecies can be extremely accurate, no two environments are absolutely equal, therefor some uncertainty always exists in any prophecy.</b>
