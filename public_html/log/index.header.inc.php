<sub1>Intro</sub1>
This is a journal of my works, mainly in the context of Complete Relativity (CR). 
Although content here is categorized, one should not take this seriously - most articles in here actually span multiple categories. Reality is the same for a mathematician, a physicist and 
anyone else. Thus, a complete description of reality cannot be categorized, as its understanding requires a mind which is sometimes a mind of a mathematician, sometimes a mind of a physicist, and 
sometimes of a different sense. 
Some of the articles may be in Croatian language only. I believe these will be translated later.
